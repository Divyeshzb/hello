This is a YAML file for creating a Kubernetes deployment of a container named "hello". The deployment ensures that there is always one replica of the container running. The container image used is "mgdevstack/hello:latest". The container is configured to run with two command-line arguments: "--foo=flag" and "--timeout=1200". The container listens on port 8080. If the container fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart it.
